The aim is to learn as much as possible only in javascript. Obviously we know that real web frontend development doesn't work this way, but the real chance now is, to focus on learning javascript in order to be able in the future to really appreciate how much useful is a framework or 3rd party library. Prerequisitesnpm and node should be installed on your system recommended npm version 3.5.0 or greater recommended node version 4.2.5 or greater Recommended but not mandatory to install gulp as a global package npm install -g gulp First time we clone or download the projectInstall dependencies and modules used for development purposes nmp install We wait until node_modules folder has been filled with all development modules needed for our app For continous developmentMain gulp task ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js or gulp if has been installed globally. Other interesting gukp tasks *vet. For syntax and quality checking Key points about the development stack we have chosen for this app Gulp as a mechanism to automate all our tasks: transpiling, concatenate, minify js code, pass code quality checkings, testing, launch test server ... ES6 as a base for all javascript code It is forbidden the use of any third party javascript library for deployment purposes. We program all with raw ES6 Babel as a transpiler from ES6 code to ES5 code 100% compatible with all modern and quite old browser ecosystem SPA. Single page application. Business logic on client side at the maximum as possible We use npm and node only as developing helping tools never as modules to be used in the production environment. Intensive use of AJAX (consequence of SPA model) InterestingES6 Modules - Single Instance Pattern https://k94n.com/es6-modules-single-instance-pattern ES6 template literals Worth to understand &quot;This&quot;common problems in javascript How Forms submit via post or get data AJAX technique CALLBACKS patterns in javascript Template system | ES6 template literals × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on November 6th 2017, 3:01:22 pm using the DocStrap template.
